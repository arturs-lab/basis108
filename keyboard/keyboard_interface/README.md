Since original keyboard that came with my Basis108 was lost, I had to create an interface to connect another keyboard to it. 
At the time XT style keyboards were still popular and in use and were much easier to interface than the new PS2 style keyboards.
This is the original version of the keyboard interface that I built. It has some problems with autorepeat and fast keystrokes. This is perhaps due to serial interface being bit-banged since the microcontroller that I used did not have a serial port.
