# History
I bought my Basis 108 in Netherlands around 1990. It appears to be a kit or early version of this computer as compared to production version that I've found traces of out on the internet. My copy came enclosed in home made case made of stainless steel with main board mounted on wooden straps glued to it. Floppy drives were mounted using metal straps resembling those found in kid's construction kits. main boards itself has no silkscreen but appears to have been produced and assembled in factory. A separate keyboard was included which was controlled by its own processor and sent keystrokes to the computer over a parallel flat ribbon cable. Sadly, this keyboard was lost.

# Platform
This computer appears to be a clone of Apple ][ with Z80 processor integrated into the main board. This allowed it to not only run Apple DOS but also CP/M. I have disks with CP/M 2.2 and 3.0. I spent most of my time in the latter writing programs in Turbo Pascal 3.0 and Z80 assembly. Besides the main board and floppy drives, the machine came with a built in power supply delivering +12, +5, -5 and -12V. I no longer have this power supply and use PC power supply instead. It also came with a Floppy Drive Controller. This controller appears to have two connectors for a typical Apple format Floppy drives. It also has some additional circuitry and what appears to be a Shugart style interface which is connected to two Teac FD-55F-03-U drives. These drives appear to have been modified to allow 80 or 40 track operation controlled by a switch mounted on front panel of computer.
