MACASM -- this is a macro assembler with characteristics similar
	to the intel assembler.  When used under cp/m, it has
	the following additional feature:  another option for the 
	list file is the letter 'p' which sends the listing to the
	list device directly; e.g., one might type
  
		MACASM LLLBASIC.AZP
 
	This will send the listing directly to the list device.
  
	There is at least one known bug (the fix is unknown, however)
	and that is that sometimes with nested macros, locations 5,6,
	and 7 are clobbered; this of course, kills communication
	with cp/m and all is dead.
